              Users may also choose to log in or link their accounts through third-party social media platforms (such as Twitter and Facebook) on both iOS and Android devices. This
              enhances user experience and login convenience.{' '}

              and other files), camera (camera), and microphone (recording). If you decline to grant these permissions, you will not be able to use the corresponding features.
              However, it will not affect your normal use of other functions of "DAKA." Additionally, we may request access to your device's location for location-based features.

              location-based services, but it will not affect your normal use of other functions of “DAKA."

            To safeguard your personal information, we will make every effort to implement various security measures that comply with industry standards. These measures aim to
            minimize the risks of your personal information being destroyed, stolen, leaked, unauthorized access, used, disclosed, or altered. We will establish a data
            classification and grading system, data security management specifications, and data security development standards to regulate the storage and use of personal

            security incidents, we have established appropriate warning mechanisms and emergency plans in accordance with legal regulations. In the event of a security incident, we
            will promptly inform you through methods such as email, letter, phone call, push notification, or other relevant means. If it is difficult to inform each individual
            data subject, we will publish relevant notices in a reasonable and effective manner. Additionally, we will actively report the handling of personal information security

            announcements, and other relevant means, and within a reasonable timeframe, delete your personal information or anonymize it. (Anonymization refers to the technical
            processing of personal information so that the data subject cannot be identified. The processed information cannot be restored. Information obtained after anonymization
            is no longer considered personal information.)
